and foreign key is the identifier for the row in a different table that is being referenced. 
2. What is an ***alias***?
an alias is a new variable that stands in for the row selected by the query
3. Demonstrate how you would query a join statement that would get all of a doctors patients from the following collections:

```SQL
CREATE TABLE doctors (
  id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  -- CODE OMITTED
  PRIMARY KEY (id)
)

CREATE TABLE patients (
  id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  -- CODE OMITTED
  PRIMARY KEY (id)
)

CREATE TABLE doctors (
  id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  doctorId INT NOT NULL,
  patientId INT NOT NULL,

  FOREIGN KEY (doctorId)
    REFERENCES doctors(id),
  FOREIGN KEY (patientId)
    REFERENCES patients(id),
)
 Select d.*,
    p.*
    FROM doctors d 
    LEFT JOIN patients p ON p.id = d.doctorId
    GROUP BY (d.doctorId)
    WHERE k.id = @keepId
```
