## Questions

Review and reflect on your experiences in this course, as this is the last lecture before your **final project**. What are your concerns? How do you plan to manage your time? What have you enjoyed most about the course up to this point?

this class has covered quite a lot so far. the biggest things im worried about for the final is just time usage. its always been my weak point.
