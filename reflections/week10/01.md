## Questions

1. What are the three categories of data types? How are they different?
value, reference and pointer types. value types directly hold values inside themselves. reference types are references to locations in memory where those values are stored. pointer types do not inherit from an object and cannot be converted between an object and pointer. 
2. What are the ***value-type*** data types? What differences do you notice from JavaScript?
bool
byte
char
decimal
double
enum
float
int
long
sbyte
short
struct
uint
ulong
ushort
 and i notice they are similar to javscript basic types but with more number types and more specific for data size
3. In your own words how do ***reference types*** get stored in memory? How does this differ from value types?
they store the value for a location in memory that holds the data type you want to reference
