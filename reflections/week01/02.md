## Questions

1. What is a ***pseudo-class*** and what are some of the most common ones you think you will use?
    a pseudo-class is a selector that allows you to selecta  class when it is in a special state
    a commonly used selector is :hover

2. What is ***specificity*** and how might you use it to your benefit?
    specificity is a built in rule to css that determines which rule should be applied to an element when it is targeted by multiple rules affecting the same properties
    it can be used to make wide rules that have low specificity and thus can be easily overwritten by less widely used rules that are more important for the few elements it covers
3. What problems do you think you could run into if you over-utilized the `!important` feature?
    it would cause your rules to be hard to overwrite meaning youd have to repeat code to achive functinality
