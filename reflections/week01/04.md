## Questions

1. What is the purpose of ***wireframing***? 

  wireframing is used to set out a guideline for your code when creating a website.  they help facilitate communication on projects between designers and clients.  

2. What are the different levels of detail in wireframes, and why is each one useful?

    low mid and high fidelity are the levels of detail. they serve different purposes in the design stages. low fidelity is for getting something to the page and looking at layout. mid is for a little more detail in the kind of styling the page will have like general assets like most of the poisoning of elements. high fidelity is used for very detailed mockups of the website usually including flow and most if not all assets

3. Do you think wireframes are worth the time, energy, and effort that they require? Why or Why not?

  i think both low and mid fidelity frames have lots of uses in most projects that make it fast and easy to design the look and feel of the website before spending the time and resources on producing code.
  high fidelity is a more niche use case.
