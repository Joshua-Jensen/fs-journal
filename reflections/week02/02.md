## Questions

1. What are the three ways to syntactically write a function? What are the differences in how the function acts (if any)?
declaration this hoists the declared function as well as naming it
expression does not hoist 
the arrow function is just a shorter syntax of function expression 
2. What is the main difference between ***parameters*** and ***arguments***?
    parameters are used when defining the function and give a name to the local variable that holds an argument
    arguments are the values that are passed to the function when it is invoked.  

3. What are ***higher-order functions***? Can you provide an example?
these are functions that either take another function as parameters or they return another function  
and example would be the find or filter function
