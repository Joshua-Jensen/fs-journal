# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is open-format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week or some of the things that you are still struggling with; identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally reflect on how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
- What did you learn that was a shock or surprise?
- What are you struggling with?
- What would you count as a victory?


i think the week went pretty well i could have finished work on the project a little faster or been a bit more focused but in the end everything got done by friday which was all that i needed to do. i do think i would have gone about certain things differently or worked at home a bit more next time.
